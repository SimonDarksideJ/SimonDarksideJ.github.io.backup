Thanks to &nbsp;good old (well maybee not all that old) Dave Webber on the XNA team for this little heads up and in case you haven’t heard yet, the XNA team are going to release another Beta of the XNA Game Studio Express V.Soon with even more goodness in the package.

Some say even hints at a first release of the XNA content pipeline and official (beta) Xbox 360 compatability.

&nbsp;

keep your ears out!
