For most of you in the know the XNA framework and XNA Games Studio Express are going to get a refresh to beta 2,&nbsp;thanks to Dave "LetsKillDave"&nbsp;Weller (still gotta love his&nbsp;alias), he has given an example&nbsp;of the changes to a sample tutorial, in this&nbsp;case&nbsp;Kurt Jagers&nbsp;2D Tile&nbsp;game tutorial (I happen to like this one a lot)

So if any of you are considering upgrading to the next Beta (I am since some of the changes now include the content pipeline and I’d rarther get these changes in now&nbsp;, fairly early into my project), I would suggest reading over Dave’s little intro and for more Beta 2 Detail head over to&nbsp;[theZbuffer](http://www.thezbuffer.com/articles/424.aspx "XNA Update rundown"), to get zMans details from the Code camp and some more examples of [changes.](http://www.thezbuffer.com/articles/425.aspx)

In my own game world, things finally have started to progress a bit, a good warning for any other aspiring beginners is this

"If your thinking of having a project that is moddable or has Loadable/Editable levels (ie not just stored in-game), start thinking about your editor first and what you need to store save"

The amount of refactoring and rework i’ve done once I started doing the map editor, is well, exhausting and a good leason to learn,lol. (whimper)&nbsp; But one i’m glad to have come though, the upside is now that the editor is well under way, the actual game mechanics are a lot easier to implement.

&nbsp;

P.S

if you read to the end Dave is definatley hinting at a sooner rarther than later release date, read between the lines and he seems to be hinting (by the end of the week), whoohoo is all I can say, roll on the content pipeline.
