Some time ago when I first started posting on XNA-UK (not my first posts ever, just when I joined XNA-UK), I focused on a very detailed 2D game development series.

It started with an original 2D tutorial series that was based on C# and DirectX run by the DigiPen institute (A game development collage in the US).&nbsp; What was good about this series is that it was one of the ones that got me started in game development, then XNA came along and I went in that direction instead.

However the tutorial was well written and a good start for any budding game developer, so some years on harnessing my knowledge of XNA I updated it and added some of my own magic (as you can see from some of the intermissions).&nbsp; When Windows Phone 7 came along I then also made it multiplatform enabling the same tutorial series to be applied to WP7.

#### Source updated for Final project [here on Codeplex](http://startrooper2dxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/61496)

#### As you can see there is a lot there and I did add a fair amount on top of the original DigiPen series, mainly to reflect current best practices with XNA and to go beyond.

I did (and still do) intend to continue on the 2D series to add more features to the basic game and provide examples of shiny stuff ![Winking smile](/Images/wordpress/2012/06/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile6.png) .

The source is still in XNA 4.0 Beta (and WP7 beta) state but I plan to update the final code to the current release soon, I will update here and in the posts as well.&nbsp; Although to be honest the code will remain the same, it is just the project definition itself that will change (which anyone can do easily by creating a new project and just copying over the code and assets – Do not forget to update the namespace if different!)

### \*\* Note, Final project code now updated and both projects have been merged into a single GS 4.0 project (Windows + Phone) and can be [found here on codeplex](http://startrooper2dxna.codeplex.com/releases/view/61496)

If you are more interested in 3D and want to skip all this 2D stuff (which I DO NOT recommend as it is good to know where the 3D stuff framework is built from) then catch the [3D XNA session I did with AT&T](http://developer.att.com/developer/Home/Community/null/Events/EventsArchive/4900052).&nbsp; Be warned the pace is quite fast (well it had to be to get 3D done in an hour!) so have the pause and rewind at the ready.

For now I am preparing for the sessions mentioned in my last post plus some others I cannot disclose yet (even had to put on hold my new MMOG, lol), So I’ll get back to you when they are done
