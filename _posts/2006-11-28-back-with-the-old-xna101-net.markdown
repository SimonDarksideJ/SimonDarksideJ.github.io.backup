\*\*Quick update

Bill has now migrated to WIndows Live spaces as well, find his new site on [http://xna101.spaces.live.com](http://xna101.spaces.live.com/) or [http://www.xna101.net](http://www.xna101.net/)

Browsed about on this site some months ago when XNA started up, but for some reason it dropped completely of my XNA radar.

Back with a vengence now with Beta2 tutorials and guides to creating a full 3D hockey&nbsp;game, Bill Reiss brings a&nbsp;good depth&nbsp;on game deelopment and collision (one of my personal hates)

Bill also brought us [Dr Popper](http://www.bluerosegames.com/dnn/) an excellent game which probably helped me in places with my own.&nbsp; Find the game and Full source on the site.
